css grid is is two dimensional layout 
flex box is one dimensional layout 


main item 

display:grid; 
grid-template-columns: 70% 30% //this gives u a 2 cols a 70% one and 30% one u can split based on the cols u want but all must add upto 100  
grid-column-gap:1em //space between cols 
grid-row-gap //space between rows 
grid-gap //gap between row and columns 
grid-auto-rows:100px // even height 
grid-auto-rows:minmax(100px, auto) // make it flexible
grid-template-columns : 1fr 1fr 2fr // size is distributed evenly based on allocaction 2fr is higher than 1
short form is  
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr) //repeate 1fr 3times
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr 2fr) //repeate 1fr 3times and 2fr 3times

u can nest it using the same ideology 


justify-items:start // align the element at the start of the col alternatives are stretch which is the default, end center this works horizontally 


align-items: start // same but align vertilcally
align-self: start // same but align vertilcally but for targeting individual items 
justify-self:start // same as as justify-items 


to target self in arangement 

box1{
    gird-column:1/3//for horizontally
    gird-rows:1/3//for vertilcally
}
span from box1 box2 box3

box1{
    gird-column:3//for horizontally
    gird-rows:1/3//for vertilcally
}

u can mix it up
